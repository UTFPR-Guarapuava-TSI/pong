Pong game in Java.
This is an Eclipse project.
The main goal was implement a framework, so the students could implement their bots to compete with each other.
Important interfaces are in the br.edu.utfpr.tsi.pong.spi package.

I used the Java library: JGame. For more information visit: http://www.13thmonkey.org/~boris/jgame/.
